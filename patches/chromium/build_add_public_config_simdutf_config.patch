Subject: build: add public config simdutf_config

To avoid building two copies of simdutf, we have electron_node ignore
third_party/electron_node/deps/simdutf and use
third_party/simdutf instead.

To accomplish this, we need to make simdutf's config public here
for use by third_party/electron_node.
